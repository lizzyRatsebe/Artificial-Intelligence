Loan Approval Using machine Learning

Machine learning is used to extract knowledge from data. A bank loan applicant status is determined using machine learning at a bank. Machine learning is capable of forecasting and predicting whether the loan applicant can receive a loan or not. The model can predict if the applicant is a defaulter thus it is an optimization strategy.
Machine learning is an application of various fields such as statistics, artificial intelligence and computer science. The field of machine learning is applied in many subjects to solve problems. An logistic model is used as an algorithm in the loan application prediction. It is used for predicting the categorical or discrete.   Data is initially loaded using pandas library. The library provides functionalities such as dataset shape description and data set datatypes this include float64 and int64. Visualizations are possible using the Seaborn library. Matplotlib is used for visualizations of graphs histograms and box-plot.
Data is transformed in the data preprocessing step. This reduces the errors in the model. Data is corrected adjusting outliers. The outliers are displayed as box plot graphs and calculations involving quartiles. Missing values are adjusted for using the mean, mode and median this replaces the otherwise missing data in the datasets. Outliers are further reduced using quartiles and the. where () function in numpy.
 Variables in our data include marriage, applicantâ€™s income Loan is typical example of binary classification. Variables are classified as into dependent(target) and independent(features). Marriage, Applicants income, co applicant income, loan status etc. Predicting follows this step using the predict function. Predicting is determining if an application is awarded or not.
 A confusion matrix is a tabular summary of the correctness of the predictions made by the classifier. Confusion matrix classifies the predictions as true positive, false positive and true negative. The confusion matrix is accuracy, recall and precision. F1 score further determines the accuracy of the model. Cross validation further for evaluation of machine learning models and their performance. Cross validation determines which model to apply in the inherent prediction. A dash board was designed to input values of the loan amount.
The model has an accuracy of 82%. The client was determined as fit for a loan.
